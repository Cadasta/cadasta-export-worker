Besides this README, the ZIP archive contains the shapefiles and XLS files containing your project's data.

Shapefiles can only store geometries of a single type: either (multi)point, (multi)line, or (mult)polygon. Because of this, you will find a shape file for each type of geometry used in your project. All shape files are provided with their corresponding *.shx, *.prj and *.dbf files.

The attribute table of each shapefile contains only the location ID and location type. The attributes for locations, parties and relationships are provided in XLS files called locations.xls, parties.xls and relationships.xls. These can be found in the 'xls' directory.
